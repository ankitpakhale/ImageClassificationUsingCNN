Classification problem flow

1.	Load dataset
2.	Data Reshaping
3.	Normalize the data
4.	Build a model (Here we have taken DL model)
5.	Compile the model (model.compile)
6.	Train the model (model.fit)
7.	Save the trained model
8.	Load trained model
9.	Evaluate the model (model.evaluate)
10.	Take prediction (model.predict)
